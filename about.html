                        <p>
                            Established in 2020 by siblings Maya and Liam, The Green Thumb Collective began as a passion project for sustainable 
                            gardening and quickly grew into a trusted local service.
                            They started by offering basic garden maintenance to friends and family, and through word-of-mouth, 
                            expanded their services to include bespoke garden design, organic pest control, 
                            and native plant consultations. 
                            Their focus is on **eco-friendly practices** and creating beautiful, low-maintenance outdoor spaces.
